## Introduction
Kood/Jõhvi is a programming school that fosters a peer-to-peer learning environment. As part of the learning process, students audit each other's completed projects to review the code, identify bugs, ask questions, and provide feedback. However, the current audit system in place is not effective. It primarily relies on yes or no questions about the project, and auditors often submit their audit codes without offering valuable feedback. Consequently, code authors miss out on crucial learning opportunities. The aim is to redefine the audit system to promote active participation and ensure code authors receive meaningful feedback throughout the process. 

### Problem
The current audit system at Kood/Jõhvi suffers from several shortcomings. Auditors often prioritize completing the audits quickly, as there are no additional rewards or incentives for thorough reviews. Simplistic yes and no questions approach fails to provide the necessary depth of feedback. Consequently, code authors receive minimal constructive criticism, impeding their learning and growth. Although auditors earn audit XP for their efforts, which is required to start new projects, it is not enough to motivate auditors for in-depth analysis and to provide valuable feedback.

### Solutions

**1. Anonymous Audits**<br>
_Implementing anonymous audits involves concealing the identity of auditors from code authors during the feedback process._

<span style="color:green">Pros:</span> Encourages unbiased and honest feedback as auditors can provide criticism without fear of repercussions. Fosters a more objective evaluation of the code, focusing solely on its quality and improvements. 

**Cons**: Lack of accountability may lead to auditors providing vague or unhelpful feedback. 

**2. entor from the School**<br>
_Assigning a mentor from the programming school involves experienced individuals guiding and conducting the code audits._

<span style="color:green">Pros:</span> Mentors can provide expertise, share best practices, and offer personalized feedback to help code authors improve their skills. Ensures consistent and high-quality feedback, leveraging the knowledge of experienced professionals. 

**Cons**: Availability of mentors may be limited, leading to potential delays in the audit process. The workload on mentors may increase, requiring proper management and distribution of responsibilities.

**3. entor from the Partnering Company**<br>
_Collaborating with a partnering company to provide mentors for code audits, leveraging industry expertise._

<span style="color:green">Pros:</span> Offers real-world insights and industry standards, enriching the feedback provided to code authors. Provides opportunities for networking and industry connections for both code authors and auditors. 

**Cons**: Coordination between the programming school and the partnering company may pose logistical challenges. The availability of mentors from the partnering company may be influenced by their workload and schedules.

**4. udit Rating and Feedback from the Auditee**<br>
_Allow code authors to rate the quality of the audit they receive and provide feedback to the auditors._

<span style="color:green">Pros:</span> Encourages a feedback loop, motivating auditors to provide more valuable and insightful comments. Empowers code authors to express their satisfaction and highlight areas where they need further clarification or feedback. 

**Cons**: Ratings can be subjective and may vary based on the expectations and preferences of code authors. Some code authors may hesitate to provide honest feedback to avoid potential conflicts or negative consequences.

**5. eward System for Good Audits**<br>
_Implement a reward system that recognizes and incentivizes auditors who provide high-quality and comprehensive audits._
<span style="color:green">Pros:</span> Motivates auditors to invest more time and effort in the audit process, ensuring code authors receive valuable feedback. Enhances the quality of audits and encourages auditors to provide constructive criticism for the benefit of code authors. 

**Cons**: Designing a fair and balanced rewards system may be challenging, ensuring it doesn't prioritize quantity over quality. The system should avoid potential biases and ensure consistent evaluation of the audits.

**6. lgorithm to Receive Better Audits base of Audit Rating**<br>
_Develop an algorithm that assigns auditors with good audit ratings to code authors to receive higher-quality audits._

<span style="color:green">Pros:</span> Encourages auditors to consistently provide valuable feedback to maintain their high ratings. Increases the chances of code authors receiving thorough and insightful audits, improving the learning experience. 

**Cons**: The algorithm's effectiveness relies on accurate and fair rating systems, which can be challenging to implement. Potential biases or limitations in the algorithm may affect the quality and diversity of audits received by code authors.
